# Note to Reviewers

I really enjoyed this project. I started from zero Angular knowledge, and after some training I was able to complete the assessment.

## What I'm proud of

- I was able to complete this assignment with very limited knowledge of Angular. 
- I was able to complete all of the user stories of the take home assessment.

## What I would improve

- Implement more tests
- Focus more time on refactoring the current code base
- Implement Material UI
